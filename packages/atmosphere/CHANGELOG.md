# Changelog

## Unreleased

## [0.18.0] - 2026-04-05

### Changed

- WebGPU entry point (`@takram/three-atmosphere/webgpu`) requires `three >= 0.182.0`.
- BREAKING: Nodes and objects no longer take `atmosphereContext` as a constructor parameter. Use `renderer.contextNode` instead.

  Before:

  ```ts
  import {
    aerialPerspective,
    AtmosphereContextNode,
    AtmosphereLight
  } from '@takram/three-atmosphere/webgpu'

  const atmosphereContext = new AtmosphereContextNode()

  const node = aerialPerspective(atmosphereContext, colorNode, depthNode)
  const light = new AtmosphereLight(atmosphereContext)
  ```

  After:

  ```ts
  import {
    aerialPerspective,
    AtmosphereContext,
    AtmosphereLight
  } from '@takram/three-atmosphere/webgpu'
  import { context } from 'three/tsl'

  // AtmosphereContextNode is replaced by AtmosphereContext:
  const atmosphereContext = new AtmosphereContext()

  // Instead of passing the atmosphere context in the parameter of classes and
  // functions, create `getAtmosphere: () => AtmosphereContext` in the
  // renderer's global context:
  renderer.contextNode = context({
    ...renderer.contextNode.value, // Merge with the existing context values
    getAtmosphere: () => atmosphereContext
  })

  // The atmosphere context parameter must then be omitted:
  const node = aerialPerspective(colorNode, depthNode)
  const light = new AtmosphereLight()
  ```

- Deprecated `AtmosphereContextNode` and renamed it to `AtmosphereContext`.
- Changed default values for `depthTest` and `depthWrite` in `SkyMaterial` and `StarsMaterial`.
- Deprecated `SKY_RENDER_ORDER`, which is no longer used.
- BREAKING: Replaced `MoonNode.normalNode` with `MoonNode.displacementNode`.
